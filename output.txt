When he became very ill,
My uncle of the highest codes,
And there was no better deal.
He claimed respect from all his folks,
But, don't tell me how it bothers
He is exemplary for others,
With no single step aside!
To nurse a dummy day and night
It is so vicious to beguile,
To entertain a moron,
To serve him medicine with a smile
Be quick and go straight to hell.
To sigh while thinking: all goes well:
To straighten pillows with a moan,
